Scenario:

Aziz’s Classic Car Restorations are a family run business based in Shahjahanpur, Dhaka. The company have large workshop where they restore a wide range of models of classic cars. In addition, they repair and service classic cars. Aziz’s Classic Car Restorations have approached you to develop a website for them, which will promote their work. They hope that this website will gain them many new customers in the future.

The website needs to feature the following: -

• A restoration projects section.
This section of the website will provide details of recent classic car restoration projects that Aziz have completed. A description of each project needs to be accompanied by suitable media showing stages in the restoration. At this initial stage of development, you only need to provide details for a few restoration projects, e.g. FOUR (4) TO SIX (6). However, it is expected that this section of the website will eventually feature many projects covering a wide range of cars. Think carefully about how the content should be organised, and how users will navigate through this part of the website.

• A services section.
This will describe the different restoration services that the company provide. For example, engine repair, bodywork, interiors, paintwork, etc.

• A latest news section.
This will be a regularly updated part of the website that will feature different news stories. Some of these will be stories about the company and
the projects they have done. But, this section will also be used to keep users up to
date with news stories about the general topic of classic cars.

• A contact page.
This will describe the contact details for the company – their address
and telephone numbers. This page will also need to feature an HTML form, which
users can fill out to make an enquiry about Aziz’s undertaking a car restoration
project. Users will need to enter details such as their name and email address.


Task 1 – HTML
The website must be developed using HTML5 and feature a minimum of SEVEN (7)
interlinked pages. 
The website must feature the content described above and meet the
following criteria:
• Feature between 7 to 10 HTML pages.
• Be usable in at least TWO (2) different web browsers. You should consult your tutor for guidance
on the specific browsers and versions you should use.
• Be viewable on monitors with screen resolutions of 1024x768 without users having to scroll
horizontally. Responsive design would be great.
• Integrate and use a range of media appropriately.
• Embed functional multimedia components in your site.
• Demonstrate a good application of web design principles and be easy to navigate and use.
• Produce a correctly structured form with range of elements.

Task 2 – CSS
Create a single external CSS file that specifies the design for the website. Each of the HTML
pages must link to this CSS file. There should be no use of the style attribute or the <style>
element in the website.
